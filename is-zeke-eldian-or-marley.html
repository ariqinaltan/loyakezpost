The Eldian race was enslaved by the Marley people after the Titans wreaked havoc on the world, and Zeke cannot reconcile himself to either the side.</span></span><h2>Is Zeke Yeager a Eldian?</h2>Due to repeated childhood trauma and stress under his demanding parents and hostility that Marley harbored towards him for his Eldian status, Zeke developed an extremely nihilistic, suicidal outlook on life that caused him to believe that he would have been better off if he had not been born at all.<h2>Is Zeke part of Marley or Eldian?</h2>History. Zeke was born to Grisha and Dina Zeke Yeager was born to Grisha Yeager and Dina Fritz, who were planning to overthrow the Marley government and put the Eldians back in power.<h2>Is Zeke with Marley?</h2>He was the antagonist until now since he sided with Marley, but the truth is he betrayed Marley and has been working with Eren. Zeke was never on Marley's side. He had a plan to save the Eldians from their cruel fate since the beginning of the series. For his plan to succeed, he had to pretend to side with Marley.<h2>Is Eldian same as Marley?</h2>Eldian is the national language of Marley and various nations across the world, due to Eldia's expansionism in the past for many centuries. Various accents and dialects exist in Marley; such as the accent found in southern Marley, which is surprisingly also present in an isolated village deep within Paradis Island.<h2>Everything You Need To Know About Marley Explained! - Attack On Titan Season 4 (Final Season)</h2><p></p><h2>Is Mikasa a Marley or Eldian?</h2>Ackermans are Eldians, but they're not affected by the power of the Founding Titan. So, yeah, Mikasa is an Eldian, regardless of her heritage. The funny thing is that she and levi can still be transported to the paths though, like when eren talked to them in the flying boat or the message he broadcast to all eldians.<h2>Is Mikasa an Eldian?</h2>We know for certain that on Mikasa's mother's side, she is not Eldian. In Season 4 Episode 10, we learned that Mikasa and her mother were direct descendants of the shogun of Hizuru and Mikasa is the rightful ruler. She's the last descendant of that royal bloodline.<h2>Does Zeke want to save Eldia?</h2>Using the Founding Titan's powers, Zeke wants to manipulate the genetic makeup of Eldians, rendering them infertile and eventually have the entire race die out. The necessity for this arises out of how the inheritance of Titan powers work in Attack on Titan.<h2>Is Gabi an Eldian?</h2>Gabi Braun (ガビ・ブラウン Gabi Buraun?) is an Eldian who lived in the Liberio internment zone and the cousin of Reiner Braun. She is a Warrior candidate (戦士候補生 Senshi Kōho-sei?, also translated as "Warrior Cadet") that is likely to inherit the Armored Titan power.<h2>Does Zeke have royal blood?</h2>Zeke has half royal blood because of her mother, Dina. While, Eren's mother, Carla, doesn't have a royal blood. Also, if Eren and Zeke touch each other, Eren could again activate the Founding Titan's power like when Eren touches The Smiling Titan, which is Dina's Pure Titan form, Eren managed to activate the founding.<h2>Why did the Titan put Zeke in her stomach?</h2>Someone must be controlling the Titan, but Eren doesn't yet have that power, and Zeke has already lost consciousness, meaning only Ymir could possibly be pulling this Titan's strings, forcing Zeke into its body.<h2>Who inherited the beast Titan after Zeke?</h2>At some point, Warrior candidate Colt Grice was selected by Marley to be Zeke's eventual successor as the Beast Titan.<h2>Why did Pieck betray Eren?</h2>Threatening to kill Eren if he does not comply, Pieck ultimately backs down due to her mission of taking Eren in alive. After telling Eren that she wishes to free the Eldians just like him, Gabi immediately accuses her of being a traitor like Zeke.<h2>Can Marleyans become titans?</h2>So it's understood that only Eldians can transform into titans, and it's assumed that Marleyans can't.<h2>Why is Zeke against Eldians?</h2>He thinks that every Eldian life (including his) is filled with misery that is not worth living that ending the live of the Eldian race is a big favour he is giving them. What is Zeke Yeager's plan?<h2>Can only Eldians become titans?</h2>Only Eldians, Subjects of Ymir, can become Titans and only Ymir's direct lineage of royal descendants can use the powers of the Founding Titan, or the Coordinate.<h2>Is Reiner a Eldian?</h2>Reiner Braun (ライナー・ブラウン Rainā Buraun?) is the Eldian Vice Chief (副長 Fukuchō?) of the Warriors and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan from the Marleyan perspective. He is the illegitimate son of an Eldian mother and a Marleyan father who grew up in Liberio's internment zone.<h2>Is Falco a Eldian?</h2>Falco Grice (ファルコ・グライス Faruko Guraisu?) is an Eldian associated with the Warriors and Reiner Braun. He is the younger brother of Colt Grice.<h2>Who killed Sasha AOT?</h2>After escaping from Marley, the cadets celebrate their victory in their attack. The noise was just enough to shield Gabi as she snuck onto the ship and shot Sasha in her chest. While bleeding out on the floor, Sasha seemed confused, asking about food and meat. This being her last word, "Meat...".<h2>Is Eren royal blood?</h2>The Founding Titan was meant to be passed down through the Reiss family's royal bloodline. Because Eren lacks royal blood, under normal circumstances he cannot access the Founding Titan's incredible abilities -- namely memory manipulation and command over hordes of pure Titans.<h2>Why did Eren reject Zeke's plan?</h2>Why did Eren betray Zeke in Attack on Titan episode 78? To put it simply, Eren betrayed Zeke because he is not in support of their plans to euthanise every Eldian on the planet until the end of time.<h2>Is Zeke a restorationist?</h2>War for Paradis arc<p>Kiyomi has a meeting with Zeke Kiyomi Azumabito reports to the Eldian military that Zeke Yeager had met with her in secret, describing himself as a true Eldian Restorationist for as long as he can remember.</p><h2>Is Levi Ackerman an Eldian?</h2>Ackerman's are eldian. Subject of Ymir is a different race and those who live in paradis are eldians.<h2>Is Ackerman an Eldian?</h2>The Ackerman clan (アッカーマン一族 Akkāman ichizoku?), also known as Ackerman family (アッカーマン家 Akkāman-ke?), is an Eldian family living within the Walls. Traditionally, they were a bloodline of warriors that protected Eldia's king, but were persecuted to the brink of extinction after refusing to follow Karl Fritz's ideology.<h2>Can half Eldians become titans?</h2>We now know that only Eldians can turn into Titans. We also know that the Coordinate doesn't work on Asians and Ackermans (and other unnamed clans). This implies that that the Coordinate only works on Eldians.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZLOdm5p6prjDopinZZ%2Bneq6t0aWcsg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jake-gyllenhaal-sex-scenes-jennifer-aniston-the-good-girl.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jake Gyllenhaal on Shooting Sex Scenes With Crush Jennifer Aniston</a>
