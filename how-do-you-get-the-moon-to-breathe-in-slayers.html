Kokushibo, Upper-Rank One, is the only Known user of this technique. Despite being inferior to Sun Breathing, it is stronger than other Breathing Techniques.<h2>What is the strongest Breathing in demon slayer?</h2>Stone Breathing is considered to be the strongest Breathing Style in Demon Slayer.

It is currently a well-kept secret within the Kamado Family, the only known people who have managed to tame this notoriously difficult breathing style.<h2>Why is Tanjiro's sword not red?</h2>In that case, since Tanjiro uses the exceedingly rare Dance of the Fire God, i.e., the Sun Breathing style, which is the origin of all other styles, it makes sense for his sword to take on the color black. It is believed that once a Nichirin sword takes on a color, it never changes again.<h2>Why did Tanjiro's eyes turn red?</h2>It was after Daki unleashed an attack and harmed multiple people, Tanjiro was extremely angry at this that his eyes were turning blood-shot red.<h2>Why does Urokodaki wear the mask?</h2>Sakonji started wearing his mask because demons used to make fun of his gentle face.<h2>Is Moon Breathing as strong as Sun Breathing?</h2>Moon Breathing is also a Breathing Style that took some parts of Sun Breathing and developed into, and yes, it is stronger than the other Breathing Styles of the demon slayers but it's nowhere near Sun Breathing.<h2>Who has Sun Breathing?</h2>Hinokami Kagura (ヒノカミ 神楽 かぐら , Hinokami Kagura?, lit.
