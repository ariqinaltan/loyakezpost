フェイスマッピングからわかること 目の下のクマは腎臓と密接な関係が
目の下のクマの種類とそれぞれの原因 目の下のクマを改善するには？ 規則正しい生活ですっきり目元にフェイスマッピングからわかること目元は皮膚が0.06㎜と薄く、肌は内臓を映す鏡といわれるように心身の状態が透けて見える。寝不足や疲労によって目の下が黒ずんだ経験から、心身と肌のつながりを誰もが感じているはず。今回ご紹介するフェイスマッピングは、そのつながりを解き明かすヒントになるといえるだろう。 足裏に反射区があるように、顔にも内臓に対応した反射区があり、海外では中医学やアーユルヴェーダの顔反射区に基づいた顔観察＝フェイスマッピングがしばしばクローズアップされている。肌トラブルを「体からの排泄」と捉え、老廃物が汗などと一緒に排出される時に、黒ずみやくすみに至ると考えるのだ。さあ、鏡を見てみよう。あなたの目元には何が現れ、何が排泄されようとしているのだろうか？

まず、目（眼球）は肝臓に対応していること、東洋医学でも目と肝臓は同じエレメントとして扱うことを理解しよう。そのため目の周りはすべて肝臓のゾーンと呼べなくもないほどで、周囲には肝臓と密接につながるゾーンが並んでいる。例えば目尻のシワや乾燥ジワが気になるエリアは、肝臓とタッグを組んで脂を消化する胆嚢のゾーン。
クマやアイバッグ（目袋）が悩ましい目の下は、肝臓と一緒に毒素を追い出そうとする腎臓の反射区が位置している。ただし目の下にクマがあるからといって「私は腎臓病なの？」と慌てないでほしい。腎臓は血液をきれいにするところ。目の下には血液の質や流れが影響しやすいのね、くらいに受け止めよう。
今回は目の下のクマについて解説。あなたの肌に何が起こっている？食事やスキンケアでどう対処したらいい？コスメ選びも含めて詳しくナビゲートしているので、鏡を見ながら確認してみて。
目の下のクマは腎臓と密接な関係が皮膚が薄い目の下は、腎臓の反射区だ。腎臓は尿を作り出すだけでなく、血液を濾過してきれいにするなど、血液の質に関わっているのをご存じだろうか？そして“肝腎要”というように、肝臓と腎臓は血液バランスの調整という大切な役目を果たしており、目の下に現れたクマやアイバッグ、肝斑やシミは血液の問題をアナウンスしている。

目の下のクマの種類とそれぞれの原因目の下のクマは原因によって現れ方も異なってくる。もっとも多くできやすい5つのクマの種類とそれぞれの原因をチェック。
1. 血行や鉄分不足が影響する赤クマさまざまなクマの中で比較的軽いのが赤クマ。ほんのり赤みがあるクマは寝不足や眼精疲労などによる血行の悪さが原因で、血行をよくするケアで回復する。ただし貧血の可能性もあるので鉄分が不足していないかチェックしてみよう。 2. 青クマは飲み過ぎや疲れているサイン？目の下の毛細血管が透けて見えることで生じる青クマ。一時的にできることが多く、飲み過ぎや強い疲労などにより血液内に老廃物が増えてスムーズに流れなくなっている状態。ひどくなると紫クマへと悪化してしまう。ゆっくり休養をとり、クマを定着させないように血流促進のためのアイケアを取り入れよう。</p></li><li><h2><a href=./love-island-representation-at-a-high-this-year-as-afia-rocks-her-natural-birthmark.html>Love Island representation at a high this year as Afia rocks her natural birthmark Sat 11 June</a></h2><div class=date>August 2024</div><p>New bombshell Afia Tonkmor just entered the Love Island villa and fans can’t get enough of her already.

Related Storyエンジェルナンバーには様々な形があり、それぞれユニークな意味を持つ。例えば、2はつながりを意味し、8は達成とバランスを、5は冒険や変化への準備を示している可能性がある。
マインドフルネスやメンタルヘルスを促進するウェルネスアプリSoaakのチーフイノベーションオフィサーを務めるローラ・ウィドニー氏は、スピリチュアル的には、4という数字は私たちを導き、励まし、ポジティブなエネルギーや自信、内なる強さを与えてくれると説明する。ウィドニー氏が言うように、特定の数字が繰り返し現れるとき、それは何らかサインであり、その意味深いメッセージに心を開き、受け入れるよう促されているのだ。
本記事では、4、44、444といった数字が示すメッセージと、それらに出会ったときにどのように行動するべきなのか、専門家の解説をご紹介。 数字の4が持つスピリチュアルな意味スピリチュアルな意味で数字の4がもたらす教訓は、夢や目標、願望に関係している。占星術の専門家によれば、私たちが望むものを達成するためには、進んで奉仕し、人から頼られ、一貫した努力をしなければならないとのこと。
数字の4は、空気、火、水、土の4つの要素を表すことができる。これらは、目標を達成するために協力することの重要性を意味する、とウィドニー氏。
また、4は東西南北の4つの方角を表すこともあるそう。ウィドニー氏によると、これは「私たちはすべてつながっており、目標や願望を達成するためには他者を尊重し、配慮する必要がある」ということを思い出させるもの。
ベリー氏によれば、数字の4の目的は、勤勉に働くことで、真に価値あるものを築くことだという。「何かを達成する責任を負ったり、自分を律することやルールの価値を理解したりすることで得られる、秩序や安心感の重要性を示しています」。 atakan//Getty Images
4、44、444が意味するものサイキックセラピストで、スピリチュアル講師であるヴィンセント・ジェンナ氏によれば、「4という数字のサインは、私たちが重要な導きを必要としていることを意味しています」。もしかすると、本来の人生の道から外れていて、軌道修正する必要があることもありえるということ。 4：人生が混沌としていたり、行き詰まりを感じていたり、試練の時に4の数字が見えたら、立ち止まって冷静になるように促されているメッセージ。地に足をつけ、一度立ち止まり、振り返るべき。逆に、目標を達成しているときに4の数字が見えたら、その歩みを肯定されているメッセージだとジェンナ氏は言う。「例えば、時計の4時44分、レシートの4、ラジオや会話で繰り返し同じ数字を聞くかもしれません」。ウィドニー氏によれば、「4という数字は、目標達成に向けて調和を保ちながら懸命に努力することを促してくれます。数字の4が持つ安定性は、願望を達成するために必要な集中力と生産性を思い出させてくれるものです」。ベリー氏にとって数字の4は、私たちがサポートを受け、助けられていることを意味する。「導きを信頼し、心の強さを持って献身を続けるようにと教えてくれるものです」。
44：4が2つ重なると、天の関与が2倍になる、とベリー氏は指摘する。「44という数字は、愛と保護が私たちを包み、安全を確保することを示しています。また、愛に満ちた導きによって、真実を伝えられているともいえます」。ウィドニー氏によると、「エンジェルナンバーの44は、私たちの今の歩みや決断が成功へ続いているため、直感に従い、今の道を続けるように促すものです」 とのこと。444：ベリー氏によると444は奇跡が起きている証拠で、「物事が好転し、障害が取り除かれているこをと示します」とのこと。困難を克服したり、より良い変化を起こすためには努力が必要で、「444は、望ましいゴールに到達するためには、努力をしなければならないことを思い出させてくれるもの」でもあるとのこと。また、「エンジェルナンバー444は、非常にパワフルなメッセージです」とウィドニー氏。「444という数字は、愛と完全性のサインでもあります。私たちが深い愛情を持つことを表しています」。恋愛における4の意味恋愛に関して言えば、4という数字が3回繰り返されるのは、その関係を安定させるよう告げているメッセージ。「たとえ現在は性的な存在であったとしても、いずれソウルメイトやツインフレームのような関係に発展するためには、肉体的な関係だけでなく感情的なつながりを築かなければならないのです。これは性別を問わず、私のクライアントにいつも言っていることです」とジェンナ氏。
肉体的なつながりも重要である一方で、安定が二人の関係を長続きさせるもの。エンジェルナンバー4が見えたら、今の恋愛に安らぎを見出す必要があることを意味しているのかもしれない。「決断を下し、今後の方向性を確立するとともに、平和を見出すことが重要です」とベリー氏。
