He was 33.</p><p>The rapper formed Underground Kingz with partner-in-rhyme Bun B while the pair was in high school, and their often laconic delivery paired with wittily dangerous lyrics influenced a generation of current superstars. T.I. had the group on as guests when he remade their 1994 song “Front, Back and Side to Side” for his “King” album.</p><p>To a mainstream audience, Pimp C was best known for UGK’s cameo on the Jay-Z hit “Big Pimpin’,” and for “Free Pimp C” T-shirts and shout-outs, ubiquitous in rap several years ago while he was jailed on gun charges. On Tuesday, his MySpace page had been changed to read: “C the Pimp is FREE at last.”</p><p>Born Chad Butler, Pimp C was found dead in a room at the Mondrian hotel, a longtime music industry hangout not far from the House of Blues on Sunset Strip, where he had performed on Saturday night alongside rap veteran Too $hort. Capt. Ed Winter of the Los Angeles County coroner’s office said Butler had apparently died while in bed in his hotel room.</p><p>“At this time there’s no signs of foul play,” Winter said. “It appears to be possibly natural, but pending autopsy and toxicology we can’t say the cause.”</p><p>Manager Rick Martin identified Butler and his death was announced by publicist Nancy Byron.</p><p>“This morning saw the loss of a man that was not only a client, but a very dear friend at a time when he had the most to live for,” Martin said in a statement. “He was my best friend and I will always love him.”</p><p>Although they never enjoyed massive pop chart success, UGK’s early CDs are considered landmarks for the then-burgeoning Texas hip-hop scene, which also featured the Geto Boys. Signed to a deal with Jive Records, they released “Too Hard to Swallow” in 1992, “Super Tight” two years later, and “Ridin’ Dirty” in 1996, considered a rap classic.</p><p>Over laid-back beats, they laid out incisive details that remain Southern rap mainstays: descriptions of sex and conspicuous consumption, wood-grain steering wheels and triple-beam scales used to weigh drugs.</p><p>The duo’s career was derailed when Pimp C was jailed for three years in 2002 on gun charges. But he got as much exposure as ever, as the “Free Pimp C” slogan spread.</p><p>An unauthorized album of Pimp C’s freestyle rhymes was released while he was in prison. When he and Bun B finally put out an album this year, they felt such a need to re-establish themselves they titled their album “Underground Kingz,” as if to underscore a new start. It topped Billboard albums chart in August.</p><p>Critics praised the CD, which included the hit “International Player’s Anthem (I Choose You),” featuring OutKast. Pimp C’s verse riffs on high-class women and cars: “I’m pullin’ Bentleys off the lot. Smashed up the gray one, bought me a red. Everytime we hit the parking lot we turn heads,” he raps.</p><p>Barry Weiss, CEO of Jive, said in a statement: “We mourn the unexpected loss of Chad. He was truly a thoughtful and kindhearted person. He will be remembered for his talent and profound influence as a pioneer in bringing southern rap to the forefront.”</p><p>Butler, who grew up in Port Arthur, Texas, came from a musical lineage. His father was a professional trumpet player, and the rapper studied classical music in high school. He even received a Division I rating on a tenor solo at a University Interscholastic League choir competition.</p><p>“That’s how I came up listening to everything,” he told The Associated Press in a 2005 interview. “Music don’t have no color or no face. It’s a universal language. I think being exposed to all that kind of stuff influences the way I make records.”</p><p>Pimp C is survived by a wife and three children.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmq5mgpbKzec%2BipKllk2KzsMHNnWSdnZGZenKBlW1pa2c%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kennedy-tucker-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sharyn Alfonsi Husband, Daughter, Salary, Net Worth Age, Wikipedia, Biography</a>
