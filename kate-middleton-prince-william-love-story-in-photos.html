at the University of St Andrews in Scotland in September 2001.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, the Prince was on the same course as his future wife (Art History) but he later switched to Geography.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair were friends at first but it's widely believed that Kate caught William's eye when she took part in a student charity fashion show in 2002, where she wore a sheer dress on the catwalk.&nbsp;</p><p>The Prince reportedly paid £200 for a front-row seat!<br></p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=89f731f8a37c-gettyimages-52546501>Romance confirmed on

romance was confirmed when she joined the royals on a family ski trip.&nbsp;</p><p>Just a few months before their graduation from St Andrews, Kate (pictured above) was once again a guest on Charles, William and Harry's skiing holiday.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=c9f31605b083-gettyimages-72831826>Kate attends William's military graduation</h2><img

rumours about an impending royal engagement went into overdrive when Kate attended William's passing-out parade at the Royal Military Sandhurst in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>She was also joined by her parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, who are said to share a close relationship with their son-in-law.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a major moment in William and Kate's relationship, as Queen Elizabeth II was also present at her grandson's graduation ceremony.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=d88d3ebe2a1c-gettyimages-106905760>Their brief break-up</h2><img

April 2007, there were reports that William and Kate - pictured at Cheltenham races just one month earlier - had parted ways.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a brief split and shortly after Kate was spotted sitting two rows behind William at the Concert for Diana that July, they reconciled their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Touching on their break-up in their engagement interview, William said: &nbsp;"We were both very young, it was at university, we were both finding ourselves as such and being different characters and stuff, it was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up, it was a bit of space and a bit of things like that and it worked out for the better."</p><p>Kate added: "I think at the time I wasn't very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person, you find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn't realised, I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you are younger and I really valued that time for me as well although I didn't think it at the time."</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=af4e2a49c27f-gettyimages-80634171>William gets his RAF wings</h2><img

was by her boyfriend's side in 2008, when William received his wings for completing his RAF training.&nbsp;</p><p>It marked their first appearance together at a formal event since William's passing-out parade two years previous.&nbsp;</p><p>And although it sparked rumours that a proposal was imminent, royal fans would have to wait two more years...</p><h2
