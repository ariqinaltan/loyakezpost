His family is a strict follower of Buddhism but Jung sometimes claims that he is an atheist which is quite common in Korea.</p><p>It is known that from his adolescent years, Jung Jaewon was interested in the KPoP industry and wanted to join them. His parents were his greatest followers.</p><p>Though the names of his parents are not public, it is known that they played a very crucial role in shaping his career.</p><p>It is also not known whether he has any siblings or not and their names are also not known.

The group consisted of himself and former Produce 101 trainee, Kim Samuel, who, at the time, was still promoted under the stage name Punch, hence the group name.</p><p>The duo debuted in 2014 with the songs ‘Nightmare’ and ‘Take Me Back.’</p><p>What drew fans to the group is that Punch used to be a trainee under Pledis Entertainment who trained with SEVENTEEN, and also the age difference between ONE and Punch, which is 9 years, something very rare in Korean groups.</p><p>Not long after their debut, a year and several singles later, ONE decided to try his hand at the Mnet variety show, ‘Show Me The Money 4,’ which led to him leaving his company and group to sign with YG Entertainment.</p><p>It took a while for fans to finally get updates about ONE’s activity and debut preparations, but, by 2017, it was announced that ONE would be making a debut under YG Entertainment as the first solo artist the agency would debut in 14 years, following SE7EN’s debut in 2003.</p><p>He officially made his debut on July 11th, 2017, with the song, Gettin’ By. The rapper also talked about how Yang Hyun-suk showed his support for ONE’s debut.</p><p>Despite initial hype for his debut after his appearance on season 4 and season 5 of Show Me The Money, YG Entertainment was unable to sustain it long-term, with fewer and fewer projects allotted to ONE.</p><p>For a while, all he did was photoshoots and appearances at brand events, but no new singles or comebacks were in sight.</p><p>It was then, in late 2017, that it was announced he would be diving into the world of acting through the drama, Hwayugi: A Korean Odyssey.</p><p>Ever since then, ONE has been promoting under his real name as an actor, mostly focusing on dramas, but he is due to debut on the big screen working under his own label PRIVATE ONLY.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jung_Jaewon_Personal_Life></span><strong>Jung Jaewon Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jung Jaewon is currently single. He is not dating anybody as of 2023.</p><p>Dating culture in South Korea is looked down upon and more so for Korean stars. Thus KPop members try to avoid drama by keeping away from such things.</p><p>This is also the case with Jung Jaewon. He is not interested in a romantic relationship with anyone.</p><p>All he wants to do is work under his own label and make a mark for himself.</p><p>He works hard for his career and given the pressure of idols to succeed, he does have to work day in and out. In such conditions, it is not possible for a person to take out time to have any relationship.</p><p>And so is the case with our Jung Jaewon.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Dom Brack Biography and Tik Tok Career</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jung_Jaewon_Net_Worth></span><strong>Jung Jaewon Net Worth&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The estimated net worth of Jung Jaewon as of the year 2023 is around <strong>$ 2 million to $ 6 million</strong>.
