singer-songwriters of the 20th century.</p><p class=paragraph-text>A pop star and teen idol-turned-spiritual songwriter, Cat Stevens' musical career has spanned over sixty years through seven different decades.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Mixing folk, pop, rock, and Islamic influences, Stevens' inquisitive and gentle style of songwriting has seen him garner numerous awards and nominations.</p><p class=paragraph-text>First reaching the top ten of the UK charts in 1967 with his debut album, Matthew and Son, he went on to find greater success in the US with follow-up albums <a href=#>Tea for the Tillerman</a>, Teaser and the Firecat, and Catch Bull at Four.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Stevens has released seventeen studio albums in total under various names, and has had four top 10 single hits both in the UK and the US.</p><p class=paragraph-text>His song 'First Cut is the Deepest' has been covered various times by the likes of <a href=#>Rod Stewart</a>, PP Arnold, and <a href=#>Sheryl Crow</a>, winning him prestigious ASCAP Awards in 2005 and 2006.</p><p class=paragraph-text>In 2014 his influential songbook was recognised by the <a href=#>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> which inducted him that year.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Throughout his life and career, Cat Stevens has been an advocate for peace and has won a number of humanitarian awards including two honorary doctorates.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>How old is Cat Stevens and where was he born?</strong></h2><figure>Cat Stevens in 1966.

He turns 75 years old in 2023.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Stevens was the youngest child of his Cypriot father Stavros Georgiou and his Swedish mother Ingrid Wickman, and had two siblings - an older brother and sister - as well as a half-brother from his father's previous marriage.</p><p class=paragraph-text>He was born and grew up in the Marylebone area of London, but moved to Sweden with his mother for a short period of his childhood before returning.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>How did Cat Stevens get his start in music?</strong></h2><figure>The 'Father and Son' singer on a beach in 1971.

If you save me I will work for you."</p><p class=paragraph-text>After being carried back to shore by the waves, brushing shoulders with death inspired him to seek a greater sense of spirituality.</p><p class=paragraph-text>His brother brought him back a copy of the Qur'an as a birthday gift having visited Jerusalem, and it encouraged him to delve deeper into the Muslim faith.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Stevens said in a 2020 interview: "I would never have picked up the Qur'an myself as a free spirit; I was more aligned to my father's Greek Orthodox beliefs."</p><p class=paragraph-text>Safe to say it completely changed his life: in 1977, Cat Stevens formally converted to Islam and officially changed his name to Yusuf Islam the following year.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Though his faith allowed him to continue as a musician, he admitted that the trappings of fame were "becoming a chore, and not an inspiration anymore", so he auctioned his guitars for charity and dedicated himself to Islam.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>What are Cat Stevens' biggest songs?</strong></h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/P6zaCV4niKk/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Yusuf / Cat Stevens - Father & Son</p><p class=paragraph-text>- 'Father and Son'</p><p class=paragraph-text>- 'First Cut is the Deepest'</p><p class=paragraph-text>- 'Wild World'</p><p class=paragraph-text>- 'Morning Has Broken'</p><p class=paragraph-text>- 'Tea for the Tillerman'</p><p class=paragraph-text>- 'Moonshadow'</p><p class=paragraph-text>- 'Peace Train'</p><p class=paragraph-text>- 'Lady D'Arbanville'</p><p class=paragraph-text>- 'Matthew and Son'</p><p class=paragraph-text>- 'I'm Gonna Get Me a Gun'</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>Is Cat Stevens married and does he have children?</strong></h2><figure>Cat Stevens/Yusuf Islam with his wife Fauzia in 2009.

That kind of stuck. So, yeah, it just stuck and then I just kept my first name, Steven and tagged Cat on to it."</p><p class=paragraph-text>He was also a budding artist before his career as a musician kicked off, and he drew the album artwork for Mona Bone Jakon, Tea For The Tillerman, and Teaser And The Firecat.</p><p class=paragraph-text>There was a period throughout the 1980s when Cat Stevens (then Yusuf Islam) alienated his long-term fanbase by supporting the call for author Salman Rushdie's execution in light of his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses, but later rebuilt his public image.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLnOqKuhqpGZtrB6wqikaKaVrMBwudSsoJxnk5bBbr%2FTnq2epqNixra%2F1J9kp5mdmnq4tcWeZJygmaGxs7HNZpignV8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./lyrics-cause-i-dont-wanna-be-a-memory-just-another-memory.html>&#171;&nbsp;Cause i dont wanna be a memory just another memory lyrics</a>
