He was 25.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Cloud’s family announced the news on Monday.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It is with the heaviest heart that we had to say goodbye to an incredible human today. As an artist, a friend, a brother and a son, Angus was special to all of us in so many ways,” said his family in the statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “Last week he buried his father and intensely struggled with this loss. The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend. Angus was open about his battle with mental health, and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The family continued, “We hope the world remembers him for his humor, laughter and love for everyone. We ask for privacy at this time as we are still processing this devastating loss.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">HBO added to THR: “We are incredibly saddened to learn of the passing of Angus Cloud. He was immensely talented and a beloved part of the HBO and Euphoria family. We extend our deepest condolences to his friends and family during this difficult time.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Cloud was&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>walking down the street</a>&nbsp;in Manhattan when he got cast as drug dealer Fezco on&nbsp;Euphoria, HBO’s Emmy-winning addiction drama from Sam Levinson and starring Zendaya. The role turned Cloud into a breakout star. His role was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>expanded in the second season</a>, which ended on a major cliffhanger for his character following a S.W.A.T. raid.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tribute shared with THR</a>, Levinson said, “There was no one quite like Angus. He was too special, too talented and way too young to leave us so soon. He also struggled, like many of us, with addiction and depression. I hope he knew how many hearts he touched. I loved him. I always will. Rest in peace and God Bless his family.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>speaking to THR </a>after the March 2022 finale, Cloud noted that his character was set to die in the first couple of episodes, but Levinson&nbsp;changed his mind to keep Fez around. Cloud saw his role expanded with an origin-story flashback to open season two and emerged as an anchor amid the swirling drama with&nbsp;<a href=#>Zendaya</a>’s Rue and her ensemble of high school friends, even sparking #Fexi social media fandom over his onscreen relationship with Maude Apatow’s Lexi.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“He just appreciated what I did, so he kept me going,” Cloud said of Levinson elevating his role. “I was excited. I was just ready to work.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Levinson was writing the already renewed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>third season</a> before the May 2 writers strike, a source tells THR. With the season now halted amid the work stoppage, it’s unclear what the creator had planned.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Cloud said at the time he wasn’t aware of Fez’s full season-two arc, as the cast typically would receive two or three scripts at a time. Even the last script kept changing, with Cloud not reading about his finale fate until they began filming. Still, he remained optimistic at the time, telling <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>THR</a>, “Everyone can change, you know? He’s just a survivor. He’s going to figure out how to make the best of situations.” He added, “Nothing in life is free. Bad things happen to good people; good things happen to bad people. Bad people do good things; good people do bad things. Luck is blind.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He also spoke about the fan response he received from the role and irony of now being approached on the street. “It’s a strange experience that I’m guessing not many people can relate to. I guess I’m just realizing that things can really never go back to how it was,” he said. “I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Mason Shea Joyce, who plays a young Fez on Euphoria, remembered Cloud’s “really sweet smile and generous soul” in a statement shared with THR. “He was kind and supportive, never too busy for a quick chat or pep talk,” Joyce continued. “It was an honor to play young Fezco.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Cloud was recently cast in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Universal Pictures’ untitled monster thriller</a> from the filmmaker trio known as Radio Silence. The film — which, along with Euphoria season three, was set to release in 2024 before the strike — is directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett and Chad Villella, who helmed the two most recent&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Scream</a>&nbsp;movies.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Other upcoming films included Freaky Tales, from Captain Marvel&nbsp;helmers Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden, and horror Your Lucky Day, produced by Luke Barnett and Adam Baxter.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Cloud finished filming on both the Universal pic and Your Lucky Day, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>THR confirmed</a>. Your Lucky Day will shortly announce its premiere strategy and release date; the Universal feature has been set for an&nbsp;April 19, 2024 release.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Euphoria&nbsp;was Cloud’s biggest credit, with the actor and<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> emerging style star</a> having previously appeared in music videos for Becky G & Karol G’s “Mamiii” and with a cameo in the late Juice WRLD’s “Cigarettes.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In 2019, he had a small role alongside Vince Vaughn, Miranda Cosgrove and Ryder McLaughlin in the Mikey Alfred skater dramedy North Hollywood and most recently starred in The Line, the Ethan Berger-directed, Alex Wolff and Halle Bailey-starring thriller about the culture of Greek Life.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Cloud was born in Oakland and attended the Oakland School for the Arts, where he focused on the technical theater arts, building sets and lighting the stage for his classmates. In 2018, he moved to New York after buying a one-way flight to the city to visit friends. It’s where he had the street encounter that led to his Euphoria audition.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While speaking with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>GQ in 2019</a>,&nbsp;Cloud described the process of portraying Fez as “a different kind of hard” from other things he’d done: “I am not running around sweating, but it’s that mental shit. You have to stay focused. You have to be on point. You can’t call in sick. Acting takes a lot out of you. I’d be drained, but I was just sitting there acting.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Abbey White and Lesley Goldberg contributed to this report.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A previous version of this story said that Radio Silence is a filmmaker duo. It is a trio that consists of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett and Chad Villella.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Aug. 1, 7:40 a.m.</strong> This story has been updated to include that Cloud finished filming on Your Lucky Day and Universal’s monster pic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOmqWgraNisK271J1knq2gnbyztcBmmJysn6d6pbHAnWRqamNqgnWEkWloaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./303612-bizzy-bone-tries-hand-at-eminems-godzilla-challenge-news.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bizzy Bone Tries Hand At Eminem's #GODZILLA Challenge</a>
