The beauty lies in the fact that he’s able to turn his hardships into art, expressing himself through music in the best way he knows how.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Clocking in at 14 tracks, Yes, I’m Sad opens with the incredibly vulnerable titular intro track, which has received nothing but positive feedback from his growing fanbase. In the chorus, Fredo raps, “Keep a poker face so they can't see I'm really mad. I know it's hard to tell, but baby yes I'm sad.” Fredo’s willingness to open up has given comfort to listeners that they too can be going through it, and still keep a smile on their face.</p><p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA - DECEMBER 12: Rapper Fredo Bang performs onstage during Lil Baby & Friends concert at State Farm Arena on December 12, 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Beyond the music, the Louisiana native has been heavy in the media for hilarious moments, such as his disappointment in A-lister’s OnlyFans or even becoming a father alongside lesbian couple Annie and Sevyn Buffins. Regardless, Fredo keeps his head down and stays perfecting his craft in the studio. Music is his life, and this project is a testament to that.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">HotNewHipHop spoke with Fredo Bang in Los Angeles to discuss the new project, what he does for his mental health, Charlemagne getting him to try Therapy, wanting to do a project with Kevin Gates, why he’s crushing on Coi Leray and more.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">I'm feeling good, blessed. Glad to see people’s reactions. I'm getting good feedback. I'm ready to keep consistent, move forward.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>I keep playing the intro track on repeat. Especially when an artist like you can get vulnerable because it shows that you're human.</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, I actually dropped a tear making that. That's how I know good ones. If I tear up when I'm making them, I’m like, 'Aw, this is a good one.'</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>What were you feeling that night when you made it? What was your mindset?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">I was just in the vibe of working. I did three, four songs. But when I was making that one, I was trying to get real personal.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Did something in your life spark this openness to being vulnerable?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">No, I just try to keep things authentic sometimes. On a daily basis, I got a habit of trying to block out emotional stuff. When I get in the studio, I'm trying to basically open myself up and release.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>How’d it feel to release that on wax?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It was good. It felt good.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>What do you do daily for your mental health?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Work. Jack off. It’s a stress-reliever, scientifically proven.</p><p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA - JULY 09: Rapper Fredo Bang performs onstage during Hot 107.9 Who's Hot Artist Showcase Concert at Believe Music Hall on July 09, 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia.

A lot of times, I prefer jacking off. Because I don't want to be talking to nobody. I don’t want to have them be sitting there, making sure that I get them there. Make sure they're accommodated.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>I feel like guys get off from getting girls though.</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, but all the time — let's just say, I might be in the mood for a three-minute nut. So I'm probably not going to make sure that you're satisfied. Instead of doing that, I'd rather just jack off.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>How often do you have sex?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Very random. I be working so much.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>How much have you spent on OnlyFans?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>In general.</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the course of three years? Probably somewhere around $7K or $8K. It’s only three years man. It’s like going to McDonald’s and spending about $10, $15. Just add up how many times you going to McDonald's in the last five or six years.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>You be getting disappointed, so what makes you keep going back?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That's the ones that I was seeing what was going on. But I have some that are very satisfying.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Would you ever join OnlyFans?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ummm, yeah.

I shot the cover in November of 2022. I shot the cover in 2022, I shot “Come Thru” in March of 2023. Everything on this tape except two songs was done a year or something ago.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>What took so long for the project to come out?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Label issues.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>That’s the worst.</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, first time going through something like that. This release brought me a lot of anxiety and stress.</p><p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA - OCTOBER 03: In this image released on October 10, 2023, Fredo Bang attends the BET Hip-Hop Awards 2023 on October 03, 2023 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Music my whole life, I don't try to invest myself into anything else. So if I can't put no music, my brain is just…</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>How are your fans responding to this vulnerable side of you?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">They liking it, because me being vulnerable is also unlocking their vulnerable side. Just things that they're dealing with and feeling.

I said I wasn't if he couldn’t get on it. Sent it to him, he f*cked with it. Because it was either that one or another song. He picked that one, jumped on it.
