dying father, which honestly is not a particular theme we come across often.&nbsp;But as presented in this case, the addressee, i.e. Dean’s dying father, was someone who had a constant presence throughout his entire life.</p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var

})();<p>His father meant so much to him that the prospect of the addressee passing is something which the singer cannot conceptualize.&nbsp;And such is this song’s thesis sentiment, i.e. Dean’s emotions being such that he can’t even conceive ‘how to say goodbye’ to his dad.&nbsp;Moreover, he is using the opportunity to let him know, most frankly put, that he doesn’t want him to die.</p><p>And yes, by the time all is said and done, even if not stated forthrightly, it can be ascertained that the addressee is indeed the vocalist’s father.&nbsp;Accordingly Dean’s mom, who is still around, also plays a role in it all.&nbsp;And one thing the singer does assure his passing father of is that he will take care of her in his absence.</p><p>Of course no matter what, Dean is never going to forget his dad.&nbsp;How can he, when he beholds his features even while looking in the mirror?&nbsp;So again, if nothing else, this song is unique in that we have a vocalist identifiable mourning his pops.</p><h5 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading"

dropped a number of tracks that have reached multi-platinum status down under.&nbsp;For instance, the biggest hit in his discography, 2018’s&nbsp;“<a href=#>Be Alright</a>“, has been certified 11-times platinum&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as of 2022</a>.&nbsp;But thus far he’s only dropped one LP, that being 2019’s&nbsp;“A Place We Knew”.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-do-i-say-goodbye>“How Do I Say Goodbye”</h3><p>“How Do I Say Goodbye” was globally released on the 2nd of September 2022. It is one of the singles from his second studio album.</p><p>It would appear that Dean Lewis debuted this song&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime around</a>&nbsp;mid-2022.&nbsp;</p><p>To note, the above analysis is of lyrics gathered from snippets as well as live performances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/How-Do-I-Say-Goodbye-by-Dean-Lewis.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dean-lewis-father>Dean Lewis’ Father</h3><p>Dean wrote “How Do I Say Goodbye” shortly after his father was diagnosed with cancer.&nbsp;That said, virtually no information is readily available on his father, and as you can see, Dean didn’t really go about expressing any personal details about him in the lyrics.&nbsp;But he did upload&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an Instagram post</a>&nbsp;in mid-August, briefly explaining the background behind&nbsp;“How Do I Say Goodbye”.&nbsp;</p><p>And as relayed, his father received a very-bleak cancer diagnosis some time ago, in which they were told that there was a very slim chance he would survive another year.&nbsp;Well apparently Terence did endure significantly longer than that timeframe. According to Dean, he was ‘always his best friend and the person he looked up to the most’.&nbsp;Therefore, he proceeded to drop this track in his remembrance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/How-Do-I-Say-Goodbye.png><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Dean’s father lived to see the release of this song. Dean later revealed via Instagram that his father loved the song.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-words-from-fans>Words from Fans</h3><p>This beautiful ode to Lewis’ father has touched the hearts of many who have been through the same situation.</p><p>A fan, who had lost his dad in October 2021, thanked Lewis profusely for this song. According to him, the lyrics are exactly what he’s been trying to express.</p><p>Another fan wrote that ever since his grandparents died last year and he didn’t have the chance to say goodbye to them, he hasn’t been able to accept that they’re gone. He continued by saying that he’s positive this track will help him let go as Lewis’ songs have helped him through tough times.</p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var r=document.createElement("script"),s=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];r.async=!0;r.src="//srv.tunefindforfans.com/fruits/apricots.js";r.readyState?r.onreadystatechange=function(){if("loaded"==r.readyState||"complete"==r.readyState)r.onreadystatechange=null,c()}:r.onload=c;s.parentNode.insertBefore(r,s)}; })();<p>Another staunch fan expressed that “How Do I Say Goodbye” is their safe place. At the time of commenting, their grandpa, who’s been like a father, is dying. After being raised by him, they have learnt the values their grandpa passed down.

Thanks.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading id=h-witnessed-heaven>Witnessed Heaven</h5><p>“I witnessed something truly remarkable at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney, Australia. Dean performed this tune with his father, and it was one of the most emotional moments of my life. I was moved to tears and could hardly keep myself together. I got chills all over my body. I could feel emotions everywhere in the packed hall. It was such a beautiful and touching moment, one that I will never forget.”</p><p><strong>– Martin</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p>Lewis Capaldi and his Dad performing “How Do I Say Goodbye” live in Sydney.</figure><h5 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-do-i-say-goodbye-a-song-that-highlights-how-fragile-life-is>“How Do I Say Goodbye”, A Song that Highlights How Fragile Life Is</h5><p>“I will never forget the moment when Dean’s ‘How Do I Say Goodbye’ came on the radio during&nbsp;a road&nbsp;trip. I had to pull over to the side of the road. This song was completely new to me at&nbsp;the&nbsp;time, but it hit me real hard. My mother’s cancer has returned after a year of remission, and I am struggling to come to terms with it.</p><p>This song reminded me that we might have to say goodbye to her soon. It’s a challenging time for me right now, and I needed to express how much this song touched me. The song highlights the fragility of life, and how we never know when our time on this earth will be over. It emphasizes that death is inevitable, and yet there is never a right way or time to say goodbye.</p><p>It also reminds me that I am not alone, and many people have gone through the same thing and have found a way to keep going. So, I will keep listening to it, find comfort in its lyrics and hold onto hope even when things seem bleak. I know that someday, somehow, I will find a way to say goodbye to my mother with love and grace.”</p><p><strong>– Phillipa</strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading id=h-feels-like-how-do-i-say-goodbye-was-composed-for-me>Feels Like “How Do I Say Goodbye” was Composed for Me</h5><p>“It looks like the duo Dean Lewis and Jon Hume had my family in mind when they composed this song. My husband is dying of cancer, and the disease has spread to his lungs already. It’s a cruel reality we have to face, and we don’t know how to break the news to our kids.</p><p>They don’t deserve this, and my heart breaks at the thought of them growing up without a father. I am worried about how to break the news to the kids and how I will bring them up alone. The emotions I go through whenever I hear it play is unimaginable.”</p><p><strong>– A Heartbroken Mother and Wife &nbsp;</strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-song-that-reminds-me-of-my-greatest-fear-in-life>A Song That Reminds Me of My Greatest Fear In Life</h5><p>“‘How Do I Say Goodbye’ exposes my greatest fear of losing a loved one. It reminds me that life is delicate, and we never know when our time will come to an end. It urges me to hold onto my loved ones, especially my dad, and treasure every moment we have together.</p><p>Despite my dad’s current good health, the song fills me with fear at the thought of losing him someday. I recognize that death is a part of life, and I can only hope to have the courage to face the pain whenever I lose a loved one.”</p><p><strong>– Abena Fosua</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvNoKSemZ6eu6i%2FwKebn5mTqcBvr86mZqGnp2KxsHnIZqqasV2cvLCwwbKcZpqpYrGmrc1mo56vmah8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-many-airports-does-louisville-have-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Many Airports Does Louisville Have</a>
